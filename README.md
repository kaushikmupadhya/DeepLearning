A small Deep Learning Project on MNIST Dataset using Autoencoders.

The MNIST Dataset of handwritten digits: A training set of 60,000 samples and a test set of 10,000 examples make up this dataset. It is a subset of a comprehensive dataset that is made public by NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology). The digits have been centered in a fixed-size image and size-normalized. It is a useful database for those who wish to try learning new techniquesÂ and pattern recognition algorithms on actual data with the least amount of preparation and formatting work.
